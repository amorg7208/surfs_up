<br/>Comparatively, the average temperature between June and December in Oahu has a difference of four degrees. With the maximum temperature difference being two degrees and the minimum temperature difference being eight degrees. 


## Summary
To further investigate the data to determine if keeping the ice cream shop open year-round is a reliable investment, we could investigate the specific locations that the weather data is being drawn from. This could help determine a premier location to build the shop for optimal sales. We could also look at precipitation to determine how often it rains which could be a factor in determining if people will go surfing, and by that, buy ice cream after. The same analysis could be run on a quarterly basis, looking specifically at March and September. This would give the stakeholders a more rounded look at weather projections.
